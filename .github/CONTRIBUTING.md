# Reporting an issue

## Before reporting

If you have found an issue with the compatibility with FFAA MOD and ACE3 please make sure that ACE3 and FFAAMOD really is the cause of the problem. To do this try to reproduce the issue with using only `@CBA_A3`, `@ace`, `@FFAAMOD` and `@FFAA MOD ACE3 Compatibility Addon` on a newly created mission.

Indicate if the issue appears on stable or development version. In case it is the development version, please also include the commit SHA-1 hash.
